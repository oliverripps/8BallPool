Recreation of the game 8 ball pool!!

DESCRIPTION:

Welcome to 8 Ball Pool!!!

To Start the game, drag the mouse back towards the colored balls, aim, and let go. How much you drag will indicate the power of the shot, shown by the power bar in the upper left of the screen. Once the balls separate and stop moving, aim the cue to hit the white ball into another ball in order to get it in a pocket. Once a ball is pocketed it will show up at the bottom of the screen!!!!

Try to ignore the slight errors with balls hitting each other, I think the code has a mind of its own.... Just know, it makes the game more fun I promise, I've played it for HOURS I would know.

If I were to revisit this project, I would incude prediction to fix bugs on collisions. Ball objects would look a few moves ahead to see if they are headed towards a collision and if a collision was within one "run" it would calculate the angle at the point of collision, as opposed to calculating after finding a current collision.

ENJOY!!!!

Quicksort on list of pocketed balls both stripes and solids in order to order them on the bottom.
