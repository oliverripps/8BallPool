# 8BallPool
Recreation of the game 8 ball pool!!


DEVELOPMENT LOG!!!

Thursday May 16
  -Got our prototype approved and Oliver began just messing around adding the framework and background images. Not much progress made(night before AP), but a little experimentation at the start.

Friday May 17th - Sunday May 19th
  -Not much more work, but added some classes and functions from the prototype


Monday May 20th:
  -Created the setup for the pool table -> stick, cue ball, and the 15 colored balls.
    Need to figure out how to differentiate stripes and solids as well as stick rotation.
  -Added Power bar which shows how hard the ball is going to be hit, with color and gives that power to the ball when released

Tuesday May 21st:
  -Worked on getting the stick to hit the ball and have it go forward.
  -Worked on getting the ball to bounce and creating roper angles.

Wednesday May 22nd:
  -Figured out merge conflicts and branching strategy going forward.
  -Created the code to detect when a ball is pocketed and having it disappear(for now).
  -Thanks to Kaitlyn Duong for helping with the idea of changing angles the ball bounces off for the right wall to test the pocketing before we can actually change the game to incorporate angle.
  
Thursday May 23rd:
-Both Oliver and Kevin had AP's the next day so we didn't do much but in class Kevin finished the rotation feature of the cue and hitting the ball at an angle on his branch.
